Hotsapi deploy cookbook
=======================

This repo is used to deploy [HotsApi](https://github.com/poma/hotsapi).

Start by running `./bootstrap.sh`. Don't forget to configure `.env` file in `/var/www/hotsapi`.

You may want to remove `usability` cookbook from run list, it contains only my personal preferences.
